# HeAR Notebooks

*   Quick start with Hugging Face -
    Example of encoding a health-related audio clip into an
    embedding vector by running the model locally from Hugging Face. There are
    different versions of this notebook for the following model formats:

    * [TensorFlow](quick_start_with_hugging_face.ipynb)
    * [PyTorch](quick_start_with_hugging_face_pytorch.ipynb)

*   [Quick start with Vertex Model Garden](quick_start_with_model_garden.ipynb) -
    Example of serving the model on
    [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/overview)
    and using Vertex AI APIs to encode health-related audio to
    embeddings in online or batch workflows.

*   [Train a data efficient classifier](train_data_efficient_classifier.ipynb) -
    Example of using the generated embeddings to train a custom classifier with
    less data and compute.
